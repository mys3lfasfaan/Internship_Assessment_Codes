Fexofenadine is an antihistamine medication used to alleviate allergy symptoms, including hay fever, conjunctivitis, eczema, hives, reactions to insect bites and stings, and certain food allergies. It is known for its non-drowsy properties.

Ranitidine, previously used for indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and stomach ulcers, is currently unavailable in the UK and globally due to concerns about potential impurities linked to cancer risk.

Promethazine, a sedating antihistamine, is used to relieve allergies, treat short-term insomnia, manage vomiting due to motion sickness or vertigo, and alleviate cold symptoms.

Montelukast is prescribed to prevent asthma symptoms and is effective for exercise-induced asthma and seasonal allergies like sneezing and itchiness.

Clonidine is a vasodilator used to prevent migraines, address menopausal hot flushes and sweats, and occasionally treat high blood pressure by relaxing and widening blood vessels.

Salbutamol alleviates asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms by relaxing airway muscles, making breathing easier.

Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, treats anxiety and associated sleep issues and is used for pre-medication before medical or dental procedures, acting by increasing the calming neurotransmitter GABA in the brain.

Spironolactone, a diuretic and anti-androgen, treats edema caused by conditions like heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and high aldosterone levels, and is also employed for hypertension.

Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, manages high blood pressure and angina by relaxing and widening blood vessels, reducing blood pressure and enhancing blood circulation.

Atenolol, a beta blocker, addresses high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats while preventing heart disease and angina by slowing the heart rate.

Paracetamol is a common pain and fever reliever found in various cold and flu remedies.

Amitriptyline is used for treating nerve pain, long-lasting pain, and to prevent migraines, functioning as both an antidepressant and pain management medication.

Erythromycin is an antibiotic used for chest infections, skin conditions, dental abscesses, and sexually transmitted infections.

Atorvastatin, a statin, lowers cholesterol and helps prevent heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes, especially in cases of high cholesterol, family history of heart disease, or certain health conditions like diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.
